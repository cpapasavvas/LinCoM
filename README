LinCoM
------

MATLAB package for the linearization of place fields in complex mazes



Description
-----------

This package was designed to help researchers in the field of hippocampal
spatial coding and episodic memory analyze their data. 

LinCoM analyzes the trajectory of an animal in a maze and the spike times 
of place cells to produce linear place fields for each path in the maze and 
for each place cell. The linear place fields are particularly useful, as 
opposed to 2D place fields, for the construction of place cell sequences.

LinCoM relies on a graph-theoretic algorithm particularly designed 
to solve this problem even in a complex maze with one or more decision 
points (e.g., T-maze, W-maze, double T-maze, radial maze).



Getting Started
---------------

The software depends on the following MATLAB toolboxes:
    Signal Processing Toolbox,
    Image Processing Toolbox,
    Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

To use LinCoM run the script runLinCoM and follow the prompts in MATLAB's 
command window. 

The package includes sample data in the groundTruth folder. Use those to 
familiarize with the functionalities of the software before using larger
datasets.
