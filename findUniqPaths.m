function [paths, seqPaths, labels] = findUniqPaths(lapsActual, lapsIdeal, adjM, distM)
%findUniqPaths clustering the runs and labeling the clusters
%   the function receives the detected runs (actual and ideal) and the
%   adjacency and distance matrix of the graph
%   it returns the unique runs/paths (clusters of runs), their sequence in
%   the trajectory and asks the user for their labels
