function [commitI, commitMap] = getCommit(uniqB, distM, endsI, ecc, adjM, frame)
%GETCOMMIT Summary of this function goes here
%   The functions gets all the elements that define the graph and asks
%   from the user to choose the commitment nodes in the graph, one for each end.
%   The path from each commitment node to its respective end is part of the
%   commitment map (commitMap). Both commitment nodes and commitment map
%   are returned.
