function [uniqBins, adjM, connM, distM, eccentr] = makeGraph(binC)
%MAKEGRAPH Gets one or more sequences of nodes and produces an undirected
%acyclic graph
%   binC is a cell array of bin sequences (repetitions expected)
%   uniqBins is the resulting set of unique bins/nodes in the graph (x,y position)
%   adjM is the adjacency matrix: square matrix with binary values
%           indicating which pairs of nodes are adjacent
%   connM is the list of all the edges/connections in the graph
%   distM is the distance matrix: square matrix indicating the distance
%           between each pair of nodes
%   eccentr is the eccentricity vector, eccentricity measure for each node
